# Simple Banking Apps by Madmink

This Simple Banking Apps is created for experimental purposes to implement my understanding of java programming language, here what will you find in this project:

- (Tons of) Questionable code
- Logic Inconsistency
- Many noob mistake

I'm trying to improve and refactor it every single day, here is the quick explanation state of this project:

## Overview
- Have 3 Main function for handling Customer, Account and handle basic transaction for banking
- Customer mainly for customer business process (CRUD)
- Account handle business cycle (CRUD) for account include updating process from transaction
- Transaction record every transactional done by Customer for each account they have
- Include several Exception and data validation that might regularly update

## Prerequisites
- Java 17 (IDK why im using this version either, might adjust it later)
- A lot of patience to read spaghetti code :)

## Upcoming plan
- Refactor to DDD with single module (for the sake of simplicity)
- Integrate with in-house SSO (will release on separate repository, soon (hopefully))
- Develop several main module like Loan, ledger for accounting cycle and reporting
- Create a proper README and other business process reference
- Create simple frontend and deployment demo (also soon, hopefully)

Feel free to use this repository as learning reference, your source of daily laughter or whatever you want to do with it
